# TASK 2
# Attendance System Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based attendance system capable of detecting and identifying students in a classroom. The system automatically marks attendance and identifies students' emotions, storing the results in a file for record-keeping.


## Description
The Attendance System Model is designed to:
- Detect and identify students in a classroom during a specified time frame (e.g., 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM).
- Mark students as **Present** if detected and **Absent** if not detected.
- Recognize and record the emotions of detected students.
- Store attendance data, including time of identification, in an Excel or CSV file.

## Requirements
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a custom model to detect and identify students.
- **Emotion Detection**: The model should classify the emotions of students while marking their attendance.
- **File Storage**: Save attendance data with timestamps in a structured format (Excel/CSV).

## Features
1. **Time-Bound Operation**: The system works only within a specified time frame, ensuring relevance to attendance scenarios.
2. **Student Detection**: Identifies individual students using machine learning techniques.
3. **Emotion Recognition**: Analyzes the emotions of detected students to provide additional insights.
4. **Data Storage**: Attendance and emotion records are saved in an Excel or CSV file with timestamps for easy access and analysis.

## Guidelines
- Train your own machine learning model tailored for this application.
- A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is not mandatory, but the model must meet all functional requirements.
- Ensure proper handling of the specified time frame for accurate attendance tracking.
- The system should be reliable and accurately fulfill the outlined tasks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning techniques in automating classroom attendance and emotion detection. The system offers a structured, efficient, and accurate approach to managing attendance records, providing an excellent foundation for further enhancements.
